# Rhythm-Game
A simple two stage rhythm game.


Requires pygame. To download pygame, paste one of the following into the terminal:
python3 -m pip install -U pygame --user
py -m pip install -U pygame --user
pip3 install pygame
pip install pygame

The 2nd one is what worked for me but it may be different for you.

If you wish to change the keybinds, you can do so where I create the keys on lines 86-89.

I used the source below to help me load map properly (keys and notes), and also to help organize my code since this person's code was generally formatted better than mine  

on line, and load the notes for each stage properly on each stageline  and load the notes
